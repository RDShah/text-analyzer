Gather 'round
I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have, listen
Keisha, Tammy, come up front
I recognize all of you, every creed and color
With that being said, fuck your ethnicity
You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you, all of you

Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high
Throw your hands up high

Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God 'cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it
I'm out of my mind so don't you mind how much the cost is
Penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up, when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiiPower

Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I am Martin Luther King with a AK-47

Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

I'm tired of y'all, 'cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it, recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol
I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that math, dropping that science like an alchemist
And I be kicking that ass
Lyrically I'm UFC, if a UFO had came for me
I'mma come back with the head of an alien, don't alienate my dreams
Get it right, get a life, I got two
That's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly
Put wings on my back, that a plane or a angel?
Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa gross

I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, I'm just a messenger
Yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them three's up, they notice that we up
HiiiPower and the power in the people and if they don't believe us, they'll die
Wizard

Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, niggaI wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimentin' me on my nappy hair
If I can f-ck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll prob'ly think I'm a terrorist
Eat my asparagus, then I'm askin' her
Thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for diamonds, I know you dyin' to meet 'em
I'll prob'ly die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted

Hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

Hol' up (Hol' up)

Yeah, big shit poppin'
Section 80

Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
Wit' my back against the wall and yo' bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothin' but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddlin' with the speed of a lightnin' bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I live my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire wit' devils holdin' hands
From the distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? There's no one
Not even myself, a Gemini screamin' for help, somebody

Hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

24/7 nigga, workin' his ass for it, she poppin' that ass for it
The King of Diamonds wit' diamonds I never do ask for
They checkin' my passport, I'm too accustomed with Customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff 'im
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor, you'll never hop in my lane
When you pushin' a RAV4, you wreckin' my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard

Hol' up (Hol' up)

I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimentin' me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll prob'ly think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor

Hol' upEight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Man, I swear, my nigga trippin' off that shit again, pick him up
Then I set him in cold water, then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope to take the pain away from the feelin' that he feel today
You know, when you part of Section.80, you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off my generation, sippin' cough syrup
Like it's water, never no pancakes in the kitchen, man
No wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
That the world is 'bout to end, who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
Playstation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream, yep
Her president is black, she black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa (They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

And then she started
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon, oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say, "Twenty-two," I say, "Twenty-three," "Okay, then we all crack babies"
Damn, why you say that? She said, "Where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors have the police relax"
I stood up, shut the blinds, closed the screen, jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough, when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up, when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body and I know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood
You know why we crack babies because we born in the eighties, that A.D.H.D crazy"

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa (They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind?

And girl that's fine but I wanna know do you mind?

Kendrick Lamar:
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a Mac book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness, of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her but when the make-up occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

Colin Munroe:
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind?

No makeup today, day, day, day, day
No makeup today, day, day, day, day, today
No makeup today, day, day, day, day

I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
Looking like a star, with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
She got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
Every time we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street, she be like

"Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other"

Until one day he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right
When he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone
Matter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial
So when she got home, it was going down, she go

"Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other"

I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist
In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this, she be like

"Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other"

Until one day he wasn't acting right in the middle of the night
She checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum
And the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon'

"Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other"

And so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
Put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that
It was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
'Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other under cover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they

Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas

I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils
There's a more important topic I'd like to discuss
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
This is your generation
Live fast and die young
Who's willing to explain this story?

Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young wild and reckless is how we live life

Kendrick Lamar:
Welcome to vigilante, eighties so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightnin' bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travellin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips, and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the nineties
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me

That Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it

Kendrick Lamar and Ab-Soul:
Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a forty ounce to the neck
And in retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a '64, better know how to drive it
I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan raked the leaves off
Your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
He copping some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
Newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger
With calendars, 'cause your date's comin'
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin'

Kendrick Lamar:
Because Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with

Just ride with me, just die with me
That gun store, right there
When you fight, don't fight fair 'cause you'll never win

Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My momma is stressing, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gonna listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that killed with ya, a squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something, or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off Death Row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'mma get it right, just so you

Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gonna have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holla if you hear me

Kendrick Lamar:
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya, will squeal with ya
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it, and don't call me lyrical
'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me?

But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break, eating in the parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard," probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for, the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He'll probably be out of work, laid back, while he

Smoke good, eat good, live good

When I should have been making bank, yeah
I was somewhere stuck where the flame is
Motherfucker, see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year (Can I get a hell yeah?)
Drop my tear, hold my joy (Show my pride)

'Member the universe used to be innocent
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Everyday that I wake up, I'mma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80

Show of hands, how many been taking notes? Good
Leave everything on the table now
Vulnerability, this is your generation
Show, show your painAsh Riser:
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Kendrick Lamar:
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
The seven cars start honking, she start running like Flo-Jo
Don't care if they Joe Blow, if they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father, that's ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
In her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

Ash Riser:
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Kendrick Lamar:
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen
What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

Ash Riser:
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Kendrick Lamar:
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure
Of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
And caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street, Keisha's song

My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, set her down and pressed play

Ash Riser:
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars, oh
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy carsAlright, here we go, third take
Real quick, Ali

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead), yessir (Amen), Chuuch
(He dead), I killed him, (Amen), Bitch

And this is rigamortus and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up, if you could fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the seventies
Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
Dead 'em all and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

(He dead), yup-yup, (Amen), I killed him
(He dead), haha, (Amen), amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead), yup-yup, (Amen), I know
(He dead), for sure, (Amen), amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC, really ballistic
Anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see some persistence
Recognize I be really too vicious the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

(He dead), yup-yup, (Amen), I know
(He dead), for sure, (Amen), amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead), yup-yup, (Amen), I know
(He dead), for sure, (Amen), amen"Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all"
(Pussy ass hoe niggas) "I can't fuck with y'all"
(Bitches all up in my business) "I can't fuck with y'all"
(Industry of counterfeits) "I can't fuck with y'all"

Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
While I'm here, and every day I hear
Your bullshit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up in the building, we get busy, and say
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
That's exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the L-I-Y
A-H, give it up two times
Then give it right back, don't blow my high

"Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all"
(Pussy ass hoe niggas) "I can't fuck with y'all"
(Bitches all up in my business) "I can't fuck with y'all"
(Industry of counterfeits) "I can't fuck with y'all"

Look at my life, then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time will never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Sip Don Perignon, when we finish, we say
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
And a button on your lips, don't blow my high

"Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall

(Bitches all up in my business) "I can't fuck with y'all"
(Industry of counterfeits) "I can't fuck with y'all"

Now everybody sing this shit

(Sung by female)
I'm sending him a four-page letter
And I enclose it with a kiss
And when I write, he'll be better
Get it on time

Look at my life and look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P(Ab-Soul)
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
There's fire in the street, fire in the swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
Before they crop us out the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
But I've cops circle the block, I puff squares
But I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch
On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams? (Uncle Sam ain't no killing me)
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary

(Sung by female)
Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell

(Ab-Soul)
Lord forbid
The homie got wet, so we tryna soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world, but we gon' manipulate it
I hope you participating
Aiyyo Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here like back in '04
Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator
And the system made to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist 'em
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if kids were celibate?
Or what is Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like chil-dren?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off twenty-twelve
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) but our future's not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast-food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine-to-five
Don't forget to pay your tithes, and thank God you alive (HiiiPoWeR)
And on another note
We focussed like the Hubble Telescope, 'Soul

(Kendrick Lamar (female))
Life is a traffic jam (life is a traffic jam)
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam

(Kendrick Lamar)
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie? I do
Section 80, your son will play me if radio won't
Daughters that just turned one to twenty-one listen to Kendrick
For instance

(Ab-Soul)
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV

(Kendrick Lamar)
True story
Hmm, can you repeat that for me 'Soul?

(Ab-Soul)
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now my child, come on

(Kendrick Lamar)
See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history
All in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
Till one day I realised I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking centre looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history
All in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar
Now fuck 'em up Terrace
('Soul!)

I watch this fire that we're gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that burns inside you
Section 80, Section 80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
No they can't control us, no they can't control you
No they can't control us, but we control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing you represent something that's bigger than all of us
Or our family
Heart, honor and represent
This is you, this is me, and we are HiiiPoWeREverybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPower

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite they tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

Just call the shit HiiiPower
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPower
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
'Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

Just call the shit HiiiPower
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPower
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

Alori Joh and Kendrick Lamar
Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, 'cause it's our life, na, na, na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long but that's alright, na, na, na

Kendrick Lamar
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa till I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
'Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost
'Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

Just call the shit HiiiPower
Yeah nothing less than HiiiPower
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

Thug life
