Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby

I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is...
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our believe's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, they paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive"
Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
I mine a couple from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
"What have you did for me"
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly 'fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switchSo I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said

(What did the Asian say?)
A peace of mind
That's what the Asian said, I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and now it's a prize
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked me what am I doing, he said "taking my time"
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, ever think of your health?
(What did the Indian say?)
A piece of land
That's what the Indian said, I needed demand
Telling me longevity is in the dirt, buy some property first
Profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now what the black man say?)
A piece of nookie
That's what the black man said, I needed to push me
To the limit, satisfy my hunger
Do it all for a woman, hair cut to a wool
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "homie, come back to reality for a week"
Nookie is power, cut on a new chick every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
(What the white man say?)
A piece of mines
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
Make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
Put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Tell me what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
I'mma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist
I don't target your market
You ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
World tour, your masters, mortgage, I need ya

I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today

What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiplyThey say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth
(Tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...)
And welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but you...)
They tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due
(Talk about the charge you got...)
And preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth
(Do you believe in God if you thought it's cool?)
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth

But head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
(Don't tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot...)
Come on give me some help, yeah
Head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on give me some help

And I just wanna
And I just wanna
Straight up
Eyes with my head
And I can't use some help
Straight up

Head is the futureSomebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow

And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me

Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And this I know

I got one hundred on my dash, got two hundred in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular I'm drunk
How can I make them popular, pop 'em when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain till your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone

Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow

And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me

Drove alone with a bottle of his own, grippin' the handle
Lit off henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel
Wait, that's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight, so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God, I still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loop holes in my bruised soul, but who knows
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king

The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligence, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple drinkers, they seein me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleep walkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink, do I see me before them Pearly Gates
Or is this just a mirage or a facade
WaitThese metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, do I let these personalities always conflict in me

Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl
I can't explain
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor

I can explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you
I can explain
Or should I know? I spend about two times
I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain
I reside
I want God
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive
You're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?
Anything you want
I can explain
Any misunderstandings, baby
Let me explain
Why don't you sit and talk to me?
Let me explain it
Let me explain

My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a 0
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections and all
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are

I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed him knowledge
I can explain
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind can travel
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
Let me explain
Or should I know?
I spin around two times, a blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the eye
I am yours
I can explain

I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yoursPart I

Part II

Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forcasted my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you
Gunshots

Part III

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on

This is a fifteen minute song
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out
Hundred thousand
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody

Now I don't let you down, and for
You see, you see, you see, you see
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now
Head is the answer
Head is the future, it's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, my background singing
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I said, girl you make me wanna uh
The whole screaming now
I said baby you make...
You make me wanna just Ah!
Baby you got me speechless right now
Laughs
I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more
Said you just make me wanna Drake you down
To the ground, to the ground ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
You just make me wanna Drake you down
Down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And baby if your mama's around, if your mama's around
If your mama's around, if your mama's around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination, she's young nigga chasin'
And she can get this dick too!

I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit, and watch what it's gon' doWhy so sad
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down, honey

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See, I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

Now why you so sad
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down, honey

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college, but she don't give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owe you, woman
Oh the anticipation of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
Three sixty-five times four plus more
If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward
My accolades better than all them

Why you so sad
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down, honey

I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby)
You know the poverty stricken, the little broke boy and babies
Somebody yell, "Kendrick, American, they sho' is crazy"
And I said "why"
Then he looked me in the eye
And said, "Nigga, you fucked up
You're banking on good luck
You wishing for miracles
You never been through shit
You're crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain't shit, I live in a hut, bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you're looking for dope
These days ain't no compromise
And your pain ain't mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain't nothing to me
Bitch, I made my moves with shackled feet
Cape Town"

In today's day and age we practice the self-pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

Why so sad
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down, honey

Pimp pimp (hooray)
