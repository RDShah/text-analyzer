Let me tell you 'bout the young man
Matter of fact, I'ma let Push tell that
Tell you 'bout the old man
Had a change of heart and then fell back
Old man lived a long life
Walked around with a long knife
You ain't cut the white like Jesus
That Colombiana, that's mi hermanos (YUGH)
Look at the flick of that wrist
I'm feelin' like Leonardo
Let me paint a picture, I might need a bottle
On the road to success, I could feel the throttle
That Michaelangelo, hundreds in the envelope
Tight shit when I write shit
And that old man had a change of heart
Wish he knew it back from the start like goddamn
Looked around, seen his wife on the ground
Military bussin' bullets all over the whole compound
Soon as he seen it, I swear it, I mean it, my members go quicker than vamonos
He dead, she dead, he in jail
Everyone fallin' like dominoes

Just money counters and kitchenwear
Condo with a bitch in there
Two scales and baggies, we got rich in there, woo!
The Rollie's been the trophy since Hawaiian Sophie
Curry over Kobe, we shootin' niggas
Splash brothers with the coca, add in baking soda

Feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I'm low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
I say oh my

I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water now I'm prayin' for a flood
Feel like time passing me by, slower than a slug
While this feelin' inside of my body's seepin' like a rug
You can hug me, rub me on the back like a child
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you'll never leave me

Wait a minute, is that-?
Ay, who's playin' that? You playin' that?
6ix you can't be playin' that, that's the album shit dawg!If you're dealing war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight

You no hear me yet?
Hear me live and direct
Walk with your tap

Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
Cause shit is different now
It's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets
Y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare - I just don't go outside
Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, "'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album
I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now
Just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday
With a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
Cause people don't buy music in this day and age
They buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong
But back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt
We call that champagne

Come some more into my sight...Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-ey-oh
Hey-oh, hey, that hey-oh, hey-oh, hey
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)
Hey-oh (All right)
Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey (All right, let's go)
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)

East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this

Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights
No lights, all for this
Tell me what you know about sleeping outside
No ride in the wintertime, all for this
Tell me what you know about commas in the bank
Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this
Tell me what you know about family never there
But swear they deserve all of this
Tell me what you know about people tryna test you
Don't wanna get involved with this
X you out, you get solved with this
Everybody gotta evolve with this
Like bitch I bet I be at the place I said I'd be
Legendary like No I.D
You know I be duckin' every ho I see
'Cause I'm out of this world, and I know I be like...

East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this

Living as a black man, in the skin of the white man
Everybody wanna fight man, and I put it on my right hand
Goddamn, it's all for this
I just wanna make the world a better place
Fuck race and the shade in my face
Looking for the sun but the shade in my face
Best in my field, I'm a slave to the race
Black motherfucker, white motherfucker
I don't give a damn what you is, can you write motherfucker?
Said I couldn't do it, said I wouldn't do it
I just made a million in a month, aight motherfucker?
I did everything I said I'd ever do and to you I still ain't shit?
Aight motherfucker
Runnin' around the world yelling P-L-P
But as a last resort, we gon' fight motherfucker like

East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this

Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-ey-oh
Hey-oh, hey, that hey-oh, hey-oh, hey
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)
Hey-oh (All right)People want to talk about what makes them happy
What really makes you happy?
Tell me what makes you happy
Makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you glad
Tell me what makes you happy
People say its money, give me the money
All the money (money)

If I could live forever and a day
Know I'd never fade away
But my life is not okay, I...
I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed
Life is fucking up my vibe, I...
I wish had a lot of money
Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper, you already know
My life would be so much better with cheddar
Only work as hard as I do for vendetta
Cause my ninth grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit
Wouldn't be nothing, working that minimum wage
And cooking McMuffins, so I'm puffing on this green
Wishing I had more money than I do
Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, ah!
And so I'm all about my business
Is there anyone who wit this?
Can a brother get a witness like: Ah-Ooh, Ah-Ooh
Wassup with it, come and get it
Tell me now what's on your mind
I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline
Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine
Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line
Somebody tell me now what done happen to society
My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety
They say that money cannot make you happy
Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke
And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?
Why you trying me, like ah...

Now I'mma tell 'em what makes me happy
This what makes me happy, right here
Like this...

Jump up on that MPC, like a boss MVP
Cook up shit that make other producers wanna envy me
Master it then set it free, turn it into MP3s
Spin that shit up in Serato, I can feel the energy

This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper, deeper than money
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
You know its deeper, deeper honey
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than your money
My money, they money, everybody money
Said, this shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
It's deeper than money

(Break)
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
Think I need to focus more on my health

I do, I do-this the shit that I love
This the shit that I love
Comes straight from above
Off the top off the dome
Gotta get it, go home
Hella late, feeling good, got a lot on my plate
What the fuck is on my mind?
I just, I just want to rhyme
This the type of shit I got to do
Oh my God, what's the time?
Can you feel it right now?
Can you feel the whole style?
It's the type of shit, I gotta get it, gotta get it
I've been vibing out here in Malibu
Would you come through?
Tell me motherfucker truly what it do?
L-O-G-I-C, this is who I be
L.A. where I'm at, M.D. what I be
All that, all that
God, I can feel it, I can feel it
I'm a fly on the wall feeling ten feet tall
Right now this the type of shit, this the style
This the motherfucking style
And so I tell em...

This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper, deeper than money
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
You know its deeper, deeper honey
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than your money
My money, they money, everybody money
Said, this shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
It's deeper than money
