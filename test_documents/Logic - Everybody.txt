Life, what's it all about?

The space between spaces
Beyond time and existential intelligence
Forget, fuck all the hippy shit, where am I?
What's the last thing you remember Atom?
I was in the store, I bought some smokes, I came outside, the phone rang, I...
How do you know my name?!
You were walking home from work when you died
Died? Dead? I'm dead? I'm dead?!
It wasn't an act of courage or bravery, but it was your time

Your wife? And son? You see, that's what I like to hear
You find out you're dead and the first thing you worry about is others
Man, answer me, what about my family? What's going on with Vanessa?
They're doing just fine. You see, your wife was cheating on you
Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!
And even though she loved you dearly
She was a bit relieved you would never find out
Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?
How you gon tell me I'm dead then gon tell me my wife cheated on me?!

Walk with me
Wait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?
No
Well, I don't see no pitchforks, little red people runnin around, it ain't too hot up in here so I guess this ain't hell either

Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this

If it was, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn't take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
Wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go

Rearrange my heart to beat good but I can't

Layers to my life, no I can't

Livin on money and women

Take it back, take it way back, take it way way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36am. Where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn't there, addicted to crack cocaine, Alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
Way, way back
So I'm gonna tell you about that, I'm gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was Happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist
Which is crazy
Because how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men But you racist
Like bitch, that don't make no sense
But it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin him a nigga
The kids at school callin him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can't be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
He saw violence, murderers, drug dealers
He was kidnapped, there was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn't be shit!
You ain't gon be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I'ma persevere
And that's why the message is always peace, love and positivity
And see, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody, was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
Because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters
That were uneducated and that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant, that cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight, and kill, and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message
Of equality, for every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and
All this, because he didn't know, he didn't know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn't right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home to about 8 or 9 hours of sleep
But spend 4, 5, 6 hours of that working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said No!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No no!
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah
Now I also want you to imagine people telling him that he did not live this life
"You just a white boy." "You ain't never experienced that shit."
"You from Gaithersburg, Maryland. Nothing happens there."
"Oh no, no, we no, we weren't there, we didn't live with you, in your Section 8 household. We didn't live with the narcotics and violence in your household. We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside." "And since you white, you gotta have money, right?"
And this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was, wasn't, and would
Never be
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah, yeah
And he's here to say:
Even though we're all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There's extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they're not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they're going to hell
You can believe it's not right
You can believe you're superior, fine
Just stop killing each otherHey mothafucka I'm real as shit
Everything I'm talkin' bout real as, real as shit

All this false information I'ma unplug, young blood
It is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov
The man in the high castle in a hot tub

But I gotta say what need be said
'Cause I ain't fuckin' with that hat with the colors that's white and red
I know some people wish I'd act white instead
Say I'd use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead
Fuck that everything I do I do it right
To teach the people that they have the power to fight
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don't get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon need patience
And not violence giving hospitals more patients, now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop!
I'm just as angry another person got shot!
Don't be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and

Everybody, anybody, somebody fill the void, somebody fill the void
Listen, I don't wanna work a job, motherfuck a 9 to 5
Every time I get a check, what I really get? Robbed
Livin' in America, this shit is a facade
But you gotta push through and persevere, word to God
Tryna find a home, but I can't afford a home
'Cause I'm 25 and owe a hunnid grand in student loans
Tryna get healthcare, but I'm on welfare
Man I swear to god, I wish I was living in Bel Air

Wit' a couple bad bitches at the crib, gettin' laid

Come now folk, get woke, stay woke
'Cause the white man want the black man stay broke
Fuck that, I'm finna buck back
But not wit bullets, I'ma use my education to the fullest
I'ma get out of debt, I'ma reset
I'ma get out of debt, I'ma reset
Do whatever you gotta do whenever to live

Excuse me?
So you sittin' here telling me, this place is a waiting room, right? What are we waiting for?
Rebirth
Rebirth?... like reincarnation?
If that's what you wanna call it
What the fuck you mean "if that's what I wanna call it?"
Either this is what it is, or this is

What it ain't
Sure
Chu mean? Ughhh, this muhfucka (Atom sighs in frustration)
Aight, lemme get this straight, every time I die, I come here, we talk, and you send me back to earth to be reborn?
Ou know the last time we had this conversation it was in mandarin and you were 13 Atom: Mandarin?
And a girl!
What? Nah, bruh, you fuckin' wit me. You're... Like, Jesus Christ
He was here too!
What? Wait, wait, so the Christians got it right?
Well I'm about to reincarnate you Atom. I'd say everyone kinda got it right
This is a whole lot to take in!
I know trust me, I've been there
So, how many times have I been reincarnated?
Many, many many many, many times
If it's so many times, why don't I remember?
F we stayed here long enough, the lives you have lived, and the knowledge from each of them would return
What?
'M actually about to send you back to 1736 as Bryan Fairfax, the 8th lord Fairfax of Cameron
Word, ay, that sounds important
Oh yes you own 40,000 acres
God damn!...oh, I'm sorry
Ha, it's quite all right
Well at least I'm not poor no more
Well sure! with all that land and the hundreds of slaves you'll own
Slaves? Aw hell nah, nononono, look look look: how you gonna take a black man, send him back in time, and now I gotta own slaves?
Well if it's any consolation, your son Tom, the 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron sets them free!
No! That does not make me feel better at all
Wait hold up, I just realized... you said you're gonna send me back in time?
Well, I'm not really sending you back in time. that doesn't exist where I come from, only in your universe
Well, where are you from?
Honestly Atom, even if I explained where I came from, or told you about the others like me, you just wouldn't understand

But if there's others like you, how can you be god?
Atom, I said you wouldn't understand!
Atom: So what's the point of doing all this?
Really?
What?
A little cliche don't you think?
Essentially asking Me the meaning of life
Well I figured I would ask before you send me back and I can't remember none of this.
Atom come here. the meaning of life... the reason I created this place... is so that you can grow, and mature
Like the human race? Like this is how the human race is supposed to grow and mature? mature into what? We can't even get along
No Atom, you! It's for you, you to mature
I don't understand
I created this place for you, Atom.
This entire place was made for you.
Every time I send you back, every life you live, you grow, and mature and understand the grand meaning behind all of this just a little more each time
Just me? Wait, what about everybody else?
Atom, there is no one else
I don't understand
Atom, you are every human being who has ever existed since the dawn of your kind on earth
Wait I'm everyone?
Ah yes, now you are beginning to see it
So I'm like, everyone that ever existed on earth, ever?
Earth? Ha, that's cute. Earth was just your birthplace.
Let us not forget all the stars humanity will colonize over the millennia
Atom: Wait, that is so much. Too much to take in!
I'm every human being that ever lived?
Or ever will live, yes!
I'm Jesus?
And all of his disciples
I'm Hitler?
And the millions he murdered
Atom: That's deep
You see Atom, every act of hatred and violence you committed against another, you were committing against yourself and every act of love and hand of kindness, you also extended unto yourself
God, why do all this?
Someday, long from now, you will become like me.
You will mature to become what I am.
I'm a god?
No, not yet. you see, I was once where you stand right now...
It is not until you have lived every human life inside of your universe that I may take you from this place.
Once you have walked in the shoes of every race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, loving and hateful person, it is only then that you will understand how precious life truly isI've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate?)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter
I know it, I know it, I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home
Ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate?)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning under water
And it's the light that's in the air
When you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on though the roads long
Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finding hope in who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you going
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate?)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymoreLucy Rose

(Speech)
It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one's body
I'm not here
I'm not me
I'm not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can't be anxiety
It can't
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
I'm so in control of my mind and my body
But I'm subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don't really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Cause now I'm just a grown up who doesn't know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxietyJesus, Black Jesus
Jesus, Black Jesus

I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don't belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don't know what's up
What's up, what's up
Yeah, yeah
Ay

I ain't here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
I'm just here to spread the clues
I'm just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ain't ashamed to be white
I ain't ashamed to be Black
I ain't ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I'm not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don't ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I'm good
Sometimes I'm misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don't wanna be
Let him hate let 'em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don't have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don't wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I'm attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I'm a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I'ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I'm black and proud
I'm just as white as that Mona Lisa
I'm just as black as my cousin Keisha
I'm biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more

I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don't belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don't know what's up
What's up, what's up

Go on and let your soul glow
Let your soul glow
Glow
Shine and glow

Black Spiderman can he save a brother now

Shit, Black Seinfeld
Black Seinfeld?
Nigga, that's Martin
Damn, you're right...
Shit, I'm fuckin' highLogic
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I'm praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you'll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I'm black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I'm adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)

Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me I'm not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but life's not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn't care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe it's in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what's gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

(Oh my) Oh my
(Oh my) Like the white women said oh my
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don't feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I can't fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah

Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don't wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I'm taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don't make a dent in how I'm feeling
And yes I'm willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I'm low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood

Such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don't waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you're not your salary. You're not your house. You're not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else's. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not 'bout the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we've been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we'll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I'm cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

J. Cole
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, accept Him
