I got a date with destiny
My heart says yeah but can't convince the rest of me
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me
I need redemption no need to mention my past
Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash
The glits the glamore the lights the camera the action
The stage the fans the speakers blastin'
You know I'm wanted I need it don't doubt it I can't live without it
It's just everything I dreamed of
It's everything I've ever wanted
But is it really truly in my plans
Or did God mix up my blue prints
Did he have it right there in his hands?
 
Anybody give me a hint
I can feel it now I know it's coming
And I don't give a fuck what anybody say
I've fallen I've risen I chose to select to dismiss an incarnation through these bars created-a prison
And I intend to do the time and the sentence that's given
25 to life yeah that's how I'm living
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever make it
But there's only way I'mma know
I'm like a seed planted in the dirt
Feels like I've been waiting forever to grow
And maybe today is the day
And maybe tonight is the night
But one thing that I know for sure
This time I'mma get it rightI don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another, human beings are like that
We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery
We don't want to hate and despise one another
In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone
The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way
Greed has poisoned men's souls
Sinatra
'Sinatra shot ya', god damn you'
'Is this what you want?'
Logic
'You are watching a master at work'
'You have interfered with our affairs for the last time'
Many men wish to acquire fame for the wrong reasons
Fans telling me never change, but it's harder fighting seasons
They hear me on the radio and now they yelling 'Treason!'
Cause Logic giving them mainstreams like Ephesians
But, I never sacrificed my lyrics or my flow
There's a time and place for everything so what the fuck you yelling for?
The fame hit me quicker than previously determined
Rat Pack, real all the time, fuck a vermin
Motivated by money, sex, drugs and violence
Cause the era that we living, it was built up on defiance
What we need is alliance, but y'all don't really hear me though
So, hip-hop's a chariot and Logic's finna carry it
Stallion, coming for their necks like a medallion
Straight out of Sierra Leone

Motherfuckers it's on, I'm under your skin like cortisone
99% of these motherfuckers is bullshit
But I'm on that Bull shit, Michael Jordan
Cutting records after the show at my hotel while I'm touring
Yeah, and I ain't even 23
But my bank account can vouch, I'm balling like an MVP
Yes it's me, L-O-G-I-C,
I'm repping MD
Now what the fuck is a vacation? I see no satisfaction
I work 12 hours a day, every day with no distraction
7 days a week and 12 hours, that's a lazy day
Going 74 hours with no sleep, call that a crazy day
This is Manhunt, and I ain't stopping till y'all apprehended
Many years I have attended and finally been commended
For keeping it real so finger fuck whoever I've offended
Now, pull out the Mac and watch them freeze like PCs
I'm Celsius, never graduated so fuck degrees
I educate 'em with ease, however listener please
Don't knock that last line, school it just wasn't for me
We all different,
And I'm here to make a killing
So say hello to the villain cause in this day that we living
And the nice guys finish last
I'm blowing up
Guess you could say I'm having a blast
'Sinatra shot ya', god damn you'
'You are watching a master at work'
'Is this what you want?'Dead Presidents III, Not to be confused with Growing Pains III
Logic this logic that, Logic sick, Logic wack
Logic just don't give a fuck, Rattpack
So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it just cease
Got-a-ca-peashe this is my house you fuckers just lease
Waitin' on a record deal that's never cumming like a priest
Black and white like a nun
These up-and-comers our sun
Like the break of dawn
So follow your father like an apostle paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil
Never knowin' what's gon' follow
However we never wallow in our sorrow
Just pray for tomorrow
At times my heart could be hallow
Emotions forced to be swallowed
While neighborhood cats blast star gas like the apollo
This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you so I'm trying to find her
One moment she'll love you then swallow you whole like an anaconda
The bitch is kinky, kind of
So with the lift of a pinky I'mma
Dominate the world like my name was brain
Spit flame like propane
Bitches I overcame you know the name
Ink in my veins, inflames, and spew on the page, to numb the pain like Novocain, muthafucker

I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Allow me to kill it off the brink like no traffic
Murderin' every demographic
Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic
Rip the mic to set the example
While all these muthafuckers testin my patience like blood samples
Constant thoughts of suicide,
Where living in an era that's do or die
Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I
But we persevere force fear enemies saying "we want nothing but peace and if not we leave 'em deceased"
In your central nervous system like heroine reppin' Maryland to the fullest
Bustin' like bullets that travel through chambers that are ignited by triggers don't pull it
I go from point A to point B by keeping it G
Ain't no killer but don't push me
If you grab the heat you a pussy
Buckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steal
I have not a single enemy
Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, In they mind
'Cause I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
And when it comes to dame's I catch plane's
They catch feelins
Haters keep my name in they mouth like villains
High as the ceiling
Y'all really don't know who your dealing with now
Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
I'm thankful for every breath I'm given
Fuck social division
On the road to success and there ain't no time for collision
People ask "how you get your flow so amazing"

To which I reply "I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions"
Haters taken shots but I never graze 'em
Now if pro is the opposite of con
What's the opposite of pro-gress
I love my country but that shit a mess
Grew up on sex and they that I can attest
And how they wonder why I claim that I'm the fucking best
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Now if I don't believe it y'all won't perceive it
Now run it back and retrieve it
Till you receive it in your motherfuckin mind
Only 22 but I feel like I'm 99
Back in 1999 that's when I began to rhyme
Surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine
Daddy was smokin' crack I was raised by a single mom
Fastin' every night I ain't talking 'bout no Ramadan
I was poor as fuck me and my momma, we didn't have a dime
At 16 the school system dismissed him and wished him well
But my momma never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?
So I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own
I left home at 17
Shortly after my momma got stabbed by fucking around in the streets
But she still breathin' which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving
So many rappers biting me you would think they was teethin'
And now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my storyYeah
Bitches be pressed for paper
Chillin' with my homie sledro while he ignites the vapor
Life is a bitch and you cannot escape her
Unless you talking suicide
What the fuck you mean that I'm changin'?
'Cause I finally gotta little bit of money and a range in my drive way
With a rattpack smoking on zimbabwe
Crankin' Sinatra that my way
Bitches they love it
Visionary nothin' above it
Get shorties wet when I rub it
Carbon copies they dub it

You used to hate it
Now you love it
Smile in my face?
I think nothin' of it
Yeah I'll shake your hand
Kill em' with kindness
Homie this is young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest

You used to hate it
Now you love it
Smile in my face?
I think nothin' of it
Yeah I'll shake your hand
Kill em' with kindness
Homie this is young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest

Yeah
This is for my independent women that is runnin' shit in high heels
Educated in business but majored in sex appeal
My shorty she gotta
Sportin' gucci louie and Prada
Looking beautiful in it all but I prefer nada
Yeah, low maintenance and high scale
Type of shorty that when you get locked up she pay the bail
I used to follow my dreams until I caught up to em'
People talking shit but pay attention to what we doin'
It's never been done
Watch me go platinum just for fun
Far from materialistic but let me stunt son
You know what I be on, you know where I be at
The proof is within the numbers they slumber but now they react
I got 3 tapes, 0 tolerance one of the greats
Put that shit together and what you get that's where I'm from
The 301, smoking joints with your girl for fun
Stand strong and never run unless the po go for the gun like

You used to hate it
Now you love it
Smile in my face?
I think nothin' of it
Yeah I'll shake your hand
Kill em' with kindness
Homie this is young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest

You used to hate it
Now you love it
Smile in my face?
I think nothin' of it
Yeah I'll shake your hand
Kill em' with kindness
Homie this is young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest

Yeah
We snatch it like interception
Met the girl of my dreams, her love resembled inception
Her sign was a leo
Me, her, and music that's the perfect trio
Spanish hunny we met in rio, future lookin' cleo
Bitches be braggin
So much money my pants saggin
VMG is up-to-date but these businessmen be lackin'
Eve bit the apple, steve changed the world
Getting money like zuckerburg, my bank account is sterol
I am not defined by that in which I do possess
Cause all it takes is riches to get bitches to undress
I need drive in a lady, not a girl that drive me crazy
Need a girl that don't care if a drive a honda or mercedes
Spit fire like hades, I infect it like rabies
It's all that, shout out to them 90's babies
Never hesitate to supply the heat
What 6ix produces from his chest, we call that shit a heartbeat
I'm a king, you fuckas my pawns
Shortcut to the desktop, I am your newest icon
These bitches they love it, I truly can't stress it enough
Girl got them daddy problems that's why she be actin' tough
Innocent in person, but in the bed she love it rough
Running away from reality to sniff coke and puff
So, let me get it the second I spit it you know that I did it all the people wanna come around
They used to hate it, but now they love the sound

You used to hate it
Now you love it
Smile in my face?
I think nothin' of it
Yeah I'll shake your hand
Kill em' with kindness
Homie this is young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest

You used to hate it
Now you love it
Smile in my face?
I think nothin' of it
Yeah I'll shake your hand
Kill em' with kindness
Homie this is young Sinatra at his fuckin' finestYeah, my name is Riley, son
But you know what niggas call me?
AKA, Riley Escobar, know what I'm saying?
'Cause I be in the streets you know?
I got all kinds of names like HR Paper Stacks
Uh, also known as AKA Horse Choker, uh

(Verse 1: Logic)
Hey, yo, I'll chop you up in sixteen pieces
In front of your nieces, while I'm eating Reese's
And won't even offer them any, yes I spit plenty
This is East Coast flow at its finest
In the studio, where you find us, put a bullet where your spine is
At sixteen I was skipping school and smoking chronic
While you was learning about English, Big L was teaching Ebonics
I spit fire so demonic, writing code like I'm Masonite
A Jedi master breaking it down like old plaster
No medication for this track cause this is how a psycho rips
My bank account is like a cino bolt, your pocket's microchips, uh
Motherfucker, I dare you to test it, hope you're well rested
Whoop your ass and get arrested, in a double breasted
Louis Vuitton diamond encrested tailor made suit
Now that's All Sinatra Everything
I explode like hollow tips on contact

Chronologically murder schmoe there's no bringing Joe back
Puffing cubans and sipping Cognac
Mafietic mentality, introduce me to this beat and it's fatality
I kill mics like Conrad Murray
Sharp like Hanzo steel, the rest is obtuse
I get loose when sipping Goose and rhyme like Doc Seuss
Flow tight like noose, whoop ass like Bruce, no time for a truce
Alphabetical mathematic addict
I spit sixteens so erratic you think it was a semi-automatic
I know by now you thinking "Oh my God, he let them have it"
But that was just a loan, time to collect like I'm Capone
Reep what I've sewn, in other words that is the throne
Chilling while homies smoking marijuan'
If you thinking that this shit is wack well then you're dead wrong
Cause for every emotion and every mood I have a song
For the club, for the streets, for the whip and for the sheets
Cause this is where intellect and versatility meets
I'm Young Sinatra, backstage chilling with BobbySoxers
I got ya

Yeah!
You wanna fuck with us?!
Fuck with us, yeah!?Yeah; pass the mic before I jack it like gore-tex
Bust like raw sex, rappers suck like vortex
The life of a Don- We living like kings, and killing our pawns
Boy, the seconds it's on - don't know where we going
I'm flowing and killing this shit from dusk till dawn
Just had sex with a Middle Eastern girl- The pussy was bomb
That last line made no sense like these rappers' careers
But I make dollars, 'cause I'm all about the fiscal year
Yeah; you don't like me? I'll conjure up and summon all your fears
You wanna fight me? I'll woop my own ass before you get here
Wanna write me? And tell me that my rhymes suck?
Bitch I don't give a fuck, I'll stab you in the gut, call it a tummy tuck
You can ask my ex, I bust quicker than two techs
Caressed by a kid with category 5 tourettes
In other words I squeeze with ease, dot my I's and cross my T's
I'm a perfectionist; the lesson is fuck everyone assessing this
It's hip-hop, not to be taken literally
However on the light of note I stayed with bills like Hilary
My flow convects, murder subjects with little respect
Best protect your neck, before you play my tape better inspect the deck
Fuck every other rapper forever ever forever since the dawn of time
Sike- I'm not that much of a dick when I rhyme
On another level like duplex, bust heads like suplex
Slaughter MC's then ask who's next...
Ey yo my crew next, but you say you next, so I guess we now
Priceless flow so even If I write it's still a freestyle
Never busting gats I ain't no gangster put that heat down
Then go and grab a mic and see if you can fuck with me now
I got that A plus flow I'm on a roll bitch I can't fail
Making money with my mind, call that shit a brain sell
Raise hell, like I'm Satan's daddy while you in here
Catch me in a tenant caddy with a bitch from Cincinnati

With the thickest fatty while I hit the gas, you lick it gladly
With the window down see other bitches blowing kisses at me
It's a fact that me and Logic rip with vicious rap to list a wrap
We spittin' crack to keep the fiends, coming back to show world
Reppin Maryland but I make music for the whole world
Seduce a chick with lyrics whenever she hear it, it make her toes curl
So sick I hope I don't hurl, if you love me let me go girl
Cause no pussy come before my flow, just had to let you know girl
Spit it so thorough and in depth, I bet I leave in you impressed
Rattpack be my family, I fuck with y'all no incest
Only interest is to blow up, and watch they hands go up
'Cause I used to throw shows back then but no one would show up
I ain't all about the money but I want it homie sho' nuff
Cause krispie crazy bout' the cream, you could say I'm doughnuts
I murdered my manager Chris last night
We exchanged a couple words, he said some things I didn't like
I said okay... then punched him in the face with a butcher knife
I want more like Ashton Kutcher's wife
Now can you feel it? They won't {Sinatra}
Gimme what I want, so fuck it I'm a steal it
I'll dilapidate you, grab the butter knife and decapitate you
Yeah that's what I said - huh, and bitch I did it
We all have thoughts like this; I'm just willing to admit it
I would never act upon these thoughts now, don't you get it?
It's like when a gentleman sees the baddest bitch and thinks, "I'd hit it!"
But he never says it; I'll dump your body in a dessert
It's the wrath of a psychopath clutching a razor blade in a bath
Having his last laugh, anticipating a gash- the other night I murdered captain crunch
Right in front of Toucan Sam and a whole damn bunch
That's life, what can I say? I'm a cereal killer, venereal dealer
And yes you know they ain't none other iller
It's Logic.Logic
Yeah, alright, yo
A couple days ago
I met the illest latina
Her demeanor was unexplainable
You shoulda seen her
Thick thighs, nice ass
Body like an hourglass
Didn't hesitate to break a brother
Next second she passed
I was like, "What's up?"
To which she replied
"How you doin'?"
I said de nada momma
But your beauty I'm persuin'
And I said I'm about to win the lottery
She asks "How?"
I said, "Your seven digits right now"
And made her smile
Now we conversing
And she feelin' my style
I can tell by the way she talkin'
That she down to go the mile
Had a couple drinks
Now we headed back to her place
The shade of red from her lipstick all over my face
I'm tryin' to hit, split it
Baby girl you gonna let me get it?
She said, "Hold up ok, I don't get down like that"
I said I know beautiful girl
But I get down like that
So let me heat it up, heat it up
Go crazy and beat it up
"Damn papi, how you even know I like it rough?"
The way you was feelin' on me
When kissing revealed enough
I wanna scratch you, provoke you
Bite you, choke you
But just a little, bite your legs
Dick up in the middle
"Hold up, wait a second
Nigga, you gotta condom?"
Come on beautiful girl of course I've got protection
I stay with Magnums and I ain't talkin' Smith and Wesson
I keep undressin'
Girl I'm about to teach you a lesson
After I hit it she says
"Bobby I have a confession
I think I love you!"
I said " What the fuck?"
Thinkin' to myself
Damn, I shoulda never cut
Kissed her on the cheek
Hit the lights, then she fell asleep
So I snuck out the bathroom window on the creep, like
(The next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, yo
The next day, the next day, the next)

Yeah, yeah, yo
Now I'm out the door
Downtown is where I'm about to go
Got a meeting with my boy Chris
About a dope show
So I hail a cab, jump in
But so does some girl
Beautiful, pretty eyes
With luxurious curls
I said "No fair"
She smiled and said
" Why don't we share?"
What a success
Lookin' at her chest
Thinkin' if her breasts was a test
She would fail
Fresh tip nails
Type of ass make a brother
Train of thought derail
As we converse
I could tell that she feelin' my style
Get the pussy wet
That's the mission
As long as she listen to my words
Feelin' on the curves
Only lips I'm thinkin' bout kissin' is hers
I can barely fight the urge
Only thing that matter right now
Is these two verbs
I'm talkin' me and you
So fine, I'd think I'd start seeing you
Her body was a work of art
Like Hieroglyphics
Too much detail to go into specifics
Now
I'm diggin' shorty
Like an archeologist
Tryin' a bone
Searchin' for a queen to take the throne
The type of girl to love
And call her my own

I'm just a bachelor (bachelor)
Looking for a bachelorette
Baby, maybe you can persuade me
To give you love
You couldn't imagine yet
Kiss you on the neck
Then I sedate the pussy like a vet
Got the shorty rollin' like a movie set
Take her to the Rio
I'm not talking about G-burg
I'm talking De Janeiro
Spend deñero like its reverb
Expansion
Couple kids running round the mansion
Day dreamin'
Getting ahead of my self
Advancin'
But, come on. girl
Now come on give me love
I know we just met but
Romance is like a drug
You know we go together
Like sympathy and hugs
So I write this girl
A symphony
And tell her that I love
Her everything
Girl I love your everything
You know I love your everything
I said I love your everything
Yeah, love your everything
Girl, I love your everythingI'm 'bout to get it right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
I'm 'bout to get it right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
Come on baby girl, tell me what you want, I got what you need
Said she independent, so don't get offended if she leave
I said I won't get offended
I'll just get some Fendi
And repress my emotions and material shit that can be a distraction
Pussy and money, sometimes I feel the satisfaction
Till I spend that bread and bust that nut and now I'm back, son
After the damage is done
Rearrange the game and let 'em know your name
Right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
I'm 'bout to get it right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
You know the drill, come on you know the deal
If my shorty acting up, I'll wife swap like Uncle Phil
Moving at the speed of sound, let's slow it down and keep it trill
Yeah we keep it real, kill 'em with kindness and not the steel
Yeah, we livin' it up
You know that this is my everything, I'm never givin' it up
All the time, all the time (yeah we do it)
And now I feel like I wanna keep going, my cards never showing
Don't know what's in hand
I love my fans, but this here girl want me, tell me I'm the man, I know I am
But never acknowledge it
Touring the country, I'm loving these colleges
Touching more pussy than a gynecologist
Study her body like I'm a biologist, with no apology
Baby girl follow me

She got low, blow my kiss of criminology
And she be loving the way I be flowing
And I know that infatuation is growing
If you catch them feelings you better be slowing it down
Slow it down, down
'Cause we both know what happens when that love come around
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you, I want you to be mine
Maybe one day it will be, but I don't have the time
Right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
I'm 'bout to get it right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
Shorty say she love me and she know every word
To every song on every mixtape
"When your album droppin'? Tell me which date
Everything you say to me, I can relate
The fact that we met right here, right now on this night, it must be fate"
Now I'll be damned, time moves so fast
Couple months back, I had a meeting with my last
Reminiscing about love, discussing matters of the past
Looking in them eyes, but I'm thinking 'bout that ass
Yeah, I took her for coffee, she took me for granted
Now I show no emotion and my shorty can't stand it
And now you know
I'm on my grind, I keep my exes in line like 'tic tac toe'
And I finally got 'em all about my vision
However, I'm all they see when they turn on the television
Right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
Right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style

That's how you make it right
Sinatra

I am literally in the air, right now, rapping up a stewardess
First class, I am so new at this
Used to ride the metro, now that shit is retro
Like the infrareds on my feet, baby let's go
Sinatra what the know me by, Logic what they call me
Gotta catch a flight but the fans wanna stall me
Life of a don, chain just glowin', always in the lab with the fresh kicks on
I'm at the MGM, rocking MCM, Bobby Soxer on my arm it's only 10 PM
Got the Rattpack with me going HAM at the hotel
Name brand everything fuck a wholesale
No, I am not materialistic
I was broke my whole life, and no I don't miss it
Last 7 years of my life was in a lab
Working everyday giving it everything I had
Now that a brother is finally recognized
I will not let the limelight hypnotize
Everybody be sure, I'mma always want more
Does anybody make real shit anymore?

Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance

The grind never stops, like I'm running from the cops
It's hard to stay humble when you're force-fed props
But I don't give a damn, I am just a man
I am not more important than any one of my fans
First name Bobby so I'm all about The Hundreds
Work so hard errybody think I'm blunted (hah)
Gunning hard with the mask and Glock
And I'mma stay with extra clips till the casket drops
Finna blow in the next three years, tops
Talking worldwide, not just hip-hop
Rappers now-a-days so flip-flop
Talking 'bout you, wanna work
Motherfucker kick rocks
I am on the come up, headed to the top
Repping MD, and never will I stop
Me and the crew V's up, Visionary what it do
Step to the mic, lyricism ensues
We go hard, only on campus when I wanna study abroad
Guess that's why they wonder if I go there
All the groupie bitches wanna put they fingers through my hair
Can't fade the thirst, chill out, whoa there
Let me get it, let me bring it back
Haters talking shit but I get richer when they doing that
Yes I am pursuing that, number one album, worldwide
And fuck whoever doubt him - Logic

Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance

Is this what you want?!
Man, what the fuck?!
The way you move is a mysteryHey, I like a girl with a big brain
A different kind of insane in the membrane
Quick game, picks up what I put down
It does a lot of good, now - look out!
I know it's the absurdest
I want a nervous system that makes me nervous
Like she's too smart, she knows all my purposes
Where I've got air I think she's got circuits
It's crazy, she won't play me
Unfazed by the flash and the hype, that's my kind of lady
Call it cold, but I'll take a brainfreeze over a fake tease
Any day, please, big brain me
We make fashion with these strange patterns
Brain is the new black - but grey matters
Cause on the runway, I don't see them
I need a phenom with a nice cerebrum

Lots of love living in her ventricles
Pump to her her brain, that's why she's so sensible
The logical knowledge beneath her follicles is plentiful
That's why this verse was an eventual reality
No TV, uh, she reads for real fun
Her mainstream media: encyclopaedia
And you know she only spell it with that 'ae'
I'm in syncope for my brainy lady
And maybe she feels the same way
I'm getting swept up under them brainwaves
If the internet's an information superhighway
Then she could be the streets, alleys, and laneways
She's nerdy, wordy, straight up otherworldly
Spits nothing but genius from behind them pearlies
Expanded my whole universe like a big bang
I like a girl with a big brain

She's got that brain that retains wisdom, fun facts, and knowledge
Uses proper grammar, her taste is quite polished
Acknowledge she could demolish your college library
Consumes all things literary
What's your favourite book? she probably read it already
Immersed in it wholly, cheeks all rosy
Snuggled all cozy, take it in slowly
Yeah, she run a book club, and I might go
Write love letters on paper that's recycled
Cycle through my rough drafts like a psycho
'Cause she'll shut you right down over a typo
She could be the one, shows me facts are fun
Son, that's one conundrum she's undone
Stunned by her shelf game, weigh bout one ton
That's my hun; she could get it, semicolon pun

Had enough of the chemicals that bang me up
And now I put the bass in her basal ganglia
Tracks on her axon, I stack songs like spines
So turn the music back on
She got a quick wit, she got a fine cap
We're together, lying back with my eyes half closed
She makes me feel weightless
Like if I'd grab z's in a spaceship
Synapse
Tell 'em I'm shelling for cerebellum
I'm magellan, hitting hemispheres
Well into any relevant melon
And maybe it's not quite unanimous
My analysis: your mind's extravagant
Bright and fabulous, it's no accident
I'm so ravenous, hypothalamus
Your cortex is a vortex I'm maxing with
Look - I like a girl with a big brain

Yeah, I be that dude with the starry eyes
For the girl teaching me about the starry skies
The astronomy major with the legs like lasers
Who's into writes thesis papers till the morning light

Yeah, when we meet, I can be set free
She gets me, it's like esp
Before we met, I always thought I was the brainy one
But this noodle's no match for that cranium

This ivy leaguer got an iv java drip
So she can stay up coding that javascript
She's got an algorithm to find a radical dude
And her hair might usb comaptible too

We box with rooks, and we're talking box
I think we've got chemistry, but she's the cook
Just gotta convince her I'm a standup guy
'Cause I like big brains and I cannot lie(Hook: Childish Gambino)
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like uh, uh, uh...

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like uh, uh, uh...

(Verse 1: Logic)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me get it right now
Let me get you aroused
Baby you been on my mind for a while now
I just wanna take some time
Write this rhyme
With a beautiful woman like you in mind
Baby be mine
I'm trying to find what makes you tic, can we talk
Maybe walk around the park
Trust me girl I stand up hard
All women ain't bitches and all
Men aren't dawgs even though we bark
'Cause I just want to get to know you
Maybe run around and show you
What a gentlemen is
Yeah, tell me what it do
Shawty I'm coming for you
Ain't talking about sex
I'm talking about something from above
I'm talking about love
Talking bout love, love, love (love)

Yeah
Now that you know that I'm for real
It's the perfect time to kill
Any fear that you may have
Baby girl I won't be mad if you ain't feeling it
But if you down you better believe I'm killing it
Take it to the crib on that late night drilling it

(Verse 2: Logic)
Wait a second, hold up
How you think I got this name
I'm all about the brain
Why you think they call me (Logic)
Ok, condom in my pocket
Lay on the bed let me rock it
Please don't stop the spit from profit
But this right here on the house
Fuck the bed, we cutting on the floor then later on the couch
Ladies give out till I gets it in
Make you scream and make you grin
From the very beginning from the second I'm in
I'm trying to tease you let me please you
Baby girl you know I need you
Do you like it, never had it
Putting work with this one right here
Yeah you know it's just for fun
Give it to you like I was trying to conceive a son
I gets it done then I'm ready for more
Ain't no telling where we'll go
But one thing that I know fo sho
This angel has no halo
I don't play no games
You can ask my ex I never eat the box
But if I control her I may select some freaky shit to start
Then bring it back
We can go for hours girl I never slept
Tell me how you want it
Face to face or rough and from the deck
Just like that she gon' overwork me if I let her
But I don't give a damn I just wanna feel better (ay)
