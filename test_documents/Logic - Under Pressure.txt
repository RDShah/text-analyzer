Aight, well, higher probably, right? Fuck it, just record it. Who cares?

I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Yeah, yeah
But I'm, not defined by the sales of my first week
Cause in my mind the only way I fail, if my verse weak
As I, look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
Compiled of different races gathering from different places
I just contemplate
Shoutout to those who can relate
And even though it gets hard I know my fate
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates
It's like, I'mma get up today
I don't know how but I'mma find a way
Looking for the sun in a world of grey
Feeling like my dream is a world away
I'mma get up today
I don't know how but I'mma find a way
Searching for the sun in a world of grey
Feeling like my dream is a world away
What it feel like
I used to wonder what it feel like
Yeah, used to wonder what it

I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race I won the gold

I used to wonder what it feel like
You can really do anything Hello
Welcome to the Under Pressure program
My name is Thalia
I will be here to assist you
With the information about the album and its creationGod damn, god damn, conversations with legends
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe and think down and leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass, I kill him, I kill him, I motherfucking kill him
I said I really want to kill him, but I can't
'Cause if I do po po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it, I grip the mic and then kill it
Okay, I'm gone, as memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin', sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can't take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day I pay homage to the Gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I'm from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking out your colon
Catch me rollin' with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, another illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like Thriller
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don't do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does

Thalia:
Hip Hop

I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be
Bitch, I said I bet I be
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me how is they gonna remember me
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love
And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop, and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Our people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending one must understand the prequelLiving life like this is so crazy
This world is amazing
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh
When they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around 'cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run her back
Cause

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)

So what now, (so what now), let's get down
Let's get drowned, on this vision, my division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'mma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say "what's your motivation?"
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy fuck a vacation, we do this for love, not no validation

Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)

Wanna get it like this
(I think so) when I'm driving, (I drink slow) when I'm vibing
(You never know, know, know, know)
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want it
But fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Grip the mic and I go (whoo!)
Fuck around with this flow

Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)

Making a single before your album is like putting together a trailer for a movie you have yet to shootYeah, livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just cause
Type of shit I see and probably wonder what it was
I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug
Basedheads coming through looking for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night its hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Living life to the fullest, I got to blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
God damn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Waking up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat (GunShots) like that
Guarantee you it's a wrap, finna put you on your back
Like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Got to leave from the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh
Just stop, stop, stop
'Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even got to drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting.
T's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355.
Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight

Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it Imma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about
What I pray about, check it uh yeah
Got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I want to run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -in the dead of night
Selling crack to my own pops
Pushing this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck
Take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck
Get down and lay down
Hit you with the Beretta and you better stay down
Straight shots on the playground
Living how I'm living with the life that I'm given
Anybody that's riding with me, I'm riding with them
Show me the enemy and Imma hit em
The second I bit 'em I get 'em and hit 'em with the venom
Ain't no need to pretend Imma never do it
I knew it, all ready been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang relatedTell me how you feel
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that's just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna to be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive

Everything happens for a reason
People only in your life for seasons
Word to Aunt Viv
Death and taxes that's all we give
You can make a life but can't make a livin'
You can make it work but that still ain't driven
Give a lot but that still ain't givin'
Livin' life like this ain't real though
Every night like this I feel so
Dead wrong, collision is head on
My vision is dead and gone
Perception of right and wrong
I been here so very long
Right here in this very song
Look around everything changes
Seem like everybody just strangers
Don't go outside 'cause it's dangerous
Why everybody wanna be famous
I'm so OCD if they notice me
I might jump out the grave so they know it's me
Man everybody want this shit for free
Hand out palm up when they get to me
In my mind know I never let it get to me
Everybody got a time will it get to me
V's up motherfucka that's victory
Tell me why what I'm doing ain't shit to me, damn

Buried alive, buried alive
Will I survive?
Buried alive
I gotta know
I gotta know
It feels like I've been buried alive
Buried alive

Let it breathe
I'm feelin' this villainous villain inside of my mind
Every time that I'm willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah
Listen up now
Love it or hate it, never debate it, you can never degrade it
While these other motherfuckers probably thinking
I made it
My mind jaded no we never evade it
To elevate it just to keep it innovative, innovated
God damn, bring it back now
Blowin' up like Iraq now
RattPack put me on the map now
No we never back down
Just take my time, I just take my time
I know, Imma get it like this
So everyone know that I did it like this
Yeah, I know
Imma take my time
Battle the image inside of my mind
I know, Imma keep going
Tell me I can't but I'm already knowing
I know, I'm gonna rise
Even though I've been buried alive
Buried alive, will I survive?
I gotta know
I gotta know
It feels like I've been buried alive
Buried alive

Let it breathe
Outkast
A Tribe Called Quest
The Red Hot Chili Peppers
And films by Quentin Tarantino
Were in rotation constantly
Throughout the duration of this album's creationUnfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment. Hopefully we will be able to in the future. Until then... how about a random page?Outside I can hear 'em bussin' bussin'
And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion
I'd rather not have this discussion
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
Where my mind, don't know now
But I know where it was
I need Nikki, where is Nikki
Baby girl please come and get me now
I'm old and shit is trippy, but I know that god is with me
This that baby mama drama
Give a fuck about a man I know Imma
Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun
End of the month, that's the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check, won't ever bounce like my daddy did
But I'm glad he did cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8, grab a plate
Food for thought, gravitate
Food stamps, social services tryna take me away
My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today
Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that's all I know
Just me and my homies, people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way, living day by day
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs
5 O with them canines
Manhunt when it's game time
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I'm running from the police, don't know how but I got away
Selling weed to my homies, and a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I'm breaking into school
Cause my homie told me to
What to do, what would you
When will I lose my anonymity and become one with the enemy?
Tell me would I be the enemy, feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe

Bobby what are you thinking?
What are you dreaming about?
Bobby, what's inside?
What are you thinking right now?
What are you thinking?
Go to sleep

I guess that I was just thinking things would be different now
'Cause when I wake up my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes
I wish that I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen, maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know
But tell me why
I picture myself at the top but I know that I'm dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons
Maybe not
All I know is this life I live I can't live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV let it wash my brain
Pretend that family's my family to avoid the pain
Hello children, how was school?
It was good, how 'bout you?
I love you (I love you son)
I love mama too
Are you ready for dinner? I'm able to set the table
Till I snap out the fable when that TV turn off and I realize I'm back in hell
(Bobby)

At the party with my homies
Walk up and they play my shit
On the road, kick a song
Didn't have to sell my soul
Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal
Where you stay, every day
Just got my crib in LA
Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ
Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh
Bitches on my dick, don't give a fuck
Y'all must not know what's up
In the cut, we don't give a fuck
We just tryna cut
Line 'em up, if they say they bout then we'll sign 'em up
Rattpack, that's a fact
Basic bitch can't fuck with that
Where you at

This album was created over the span of one year. However, the majority of the album was recorded in only two weeksSometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes, everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it, but right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone

Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude
I look out of the window like goddamn, that's what I really do
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain
If I look back on it I would do it all over again
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Crazy racist white bitch looking at us like "Who are these niggas?"
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam, oh my God this is my jam
May-December by Mos Def in my headphones, that's the man

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high

Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own
These thoughts inside my mind, be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

I can't believe you don't like Tarantino
Ugh, I don't like him because, like, when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie
You mean like Inglourious Basterds?
I didn't see that
What?!
I didn't, I don't know
Oh my God, have you seen Pulp Fiction
Yeah, but I don't really remember it
What you talking about? Have you seen uh, this is funny 'cause we're on the train, have you seen, fuck! What's his name. The guy from the movie, in the place on the
On the train? With the scenery?
Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit, Source Code
No
You haven't seen that?
No
With the dude from Donnie Darko
Who's that?
Oh my God
Well I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high

The original members of the Rattpack include, C Dot Castro, Big Lenbo and LogicI can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go
Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black
Tell me where you've been jack
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name Mary
I used to fuck here way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together swear to god I saw that work
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go I always know you there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you
Nothing can replace you
I wish I could erase you, you're everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask what's wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in a grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine

Slave for the
Said I'm a slave for the nicotine
Been a slave for ya
I'm a mothafuckin slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine
Nikki, Nikki slave for ya
I'm a slave for ya Nikki
I'm a mothafuckin slave for ya

Thalia:
All handwriting on the album's artwork was done by Big LenboWork so fucking much my greatest fear is I'mma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks
Who the bitch riding with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally getting cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up, where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho
Caked up till I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be asking us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judas is who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch I'm still the same
Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasing fame, chasing glory, till the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I been working hard, I been searching for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
Cause lately you feel like I'm just not your sister at all, all
I'm sorry for calling and balling, I'm all in
And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more like mommy, I know I'm me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
As as for (?) he left and he ain't coming back
I hate the man, if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting, selling that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
And Paris, what a beautiful destination
And perish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way I say "hey, I'm your dad"
It gets me thinking of incredible moments we've had
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of your family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand with me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feeling under pressure

Hey, what's up, bro? I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. All right, nigga

Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now
I heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vile
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I called you wouldn't even answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the ones you don't know, my sister, some of your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati. Then I gotta jail you out. I love you, son. SoIt's the type of shit they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and Big
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant for me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again 'cause I love this shit
Write it down and they publish it
I went 5 years without a publicist, cause the word of mouth, they in love with this
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming
Went away a while but I've been fiending
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal
Been that way before the deal
Now the music got mass appeal
My main girl got ass appeal
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing
Little fish, that went mainstream
Now I'm big as fuck
My whole city, they know what's up
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit
I don't give a fuck
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt
When I'm talking business, I might erupt
If you're at the show, put your lighter up
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it
Outsiders, I could do without it
I crept in, got slept on
Sold out shows, no one knew about it
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it
Your cosign, I could do without it

Laaa daaaa
Laaa daaaa la da da da daa da da da da da daaa

Okay, last verse I gotta make it count
Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I'd have to pause and I can't afford to just waste the bars
Every day boy I thank the Lord, I got a lot of problems but could have more
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less
I been hungry like Budapest
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck I just know I'm blessed
Love life even though I'm stressed
This business boy, I swear a test
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check, I'll send Chris to go cut their neck
I love the building, no disrespect
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist, Imma intercept
It's my time, put half a mill of my own money in this album
That's my dime
No rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine
From the basement to the stadium
From the Roxy to Palladium
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor, half naked playing Connect Four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind and then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like go ahead
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme
So I gotta go, it's Logic
The one nobody would vouch for, how's that shit for an outro

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
This is my story, Till The End
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
This is my story, Till The End
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Yeah

Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them
They may be misinformed about the truth
They may be misguided
Somebody has led them on the wrong path
A path of corruption and destruction, but yet God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved

Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Yeah

This concludes the Under Pressure program
