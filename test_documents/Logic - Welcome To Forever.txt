Hey, I like a girl with a big brain
A different kind of insane in the membrane
Quick game, picks up what I put down
It does a lot of good, now - look out!
I know it's the absurdest
I want a nervous system that makes me nervous
Like she's too smart, she knows all my purposes
Where I've got air I think she's got circuits
It's crazy, she won't play me
Unfazed by the flash and the hype, that's my kind of lady
Call it cold, but I'll take a brainfreeze over a fake tease
Any day, please, big brain me
We make fashion with these strange patterns
Brain is the new black - but grey matters
Cause on the runway, I don't see them
I need a phenom with a nice cerebrum

Lots of love living in her ventricles
Pump to her her brain, that's why she's so sensible
The logical knowledge beneath her follicles is plentiful
That's why this verse was an eventual reality
No TV, uh, she reads for real fun
Her mainstream media: encyclopaedia
And you know she only spell it with that 'ae'
I'm in syncope for my brainy lady
And maybe she feels the same way
I'm getting swept up under them brainwaves
If the internet's an information superhighway
Then she could be the streets, alleys, and laneways
She's nerdy, wordy, straight up otherworldly
Spits nothing but genius from behind them pearlies
Expanded my whole universe like a big bang
I like a girl with a big brain

She's got that brain that retains wisdom, fun facts, and knowledge
Uses proper grammar, her taste is quite polished
Acknowledge she could demolish your college library
Consumes all things literary
What's your favourite book? she probably read it already
Immersed in it wholly, cheeks all rosy
Snuggled all cozy, take it in slowly
Yeah, she run a book club, and I might go
Write love letters on paper that's recycled
Cycle through my rough drafts like a psycho
'Cause she'll shut you right down over a typo
She could be the one, shows me facts are fun
Son, that's one conundrum she's undone
Stunned by her shelf game, weigh bout one ton
That's my hun; she could get it, semicolon pun

Had enough of the chemicals that bang me up
And now I put the bass in her basal ganglia
Tracks on her axon, I stack songs like spines
So turn the music back on
She got a quick wit, she got a fine cap
We're together, lying back with my eyes half closed
She makes me feel weightless
Like if I'd grab z's in a spaceship
Synapse
Tell 'em I'm shelling for cerebellum
I'm magellan, hitting hemispheres
Well into any relevant melon
And maybe it's not quite unanimous
My analysis: your mind's extravagant
Bright and fabulous, it's no accident
I'm so ravenous, hypothalamus
Your cortex is a vortex I'm maxing with
Look - I like a girl with a big brain

Yeah, I be that dude with the starry eyes
For the girl teaching me about the starry skies
The astronomy major with the legs like lasers
Who's into writes thesis papers till the morning light

Yeah, when we meet, I can be set free
She gets me, it's like esp
Before we met, I always thought I was the brainy one
But this noodle's no match for that cranium

This ivy leaguer got an iv java drip
So she can stay up coding that javascript
She's got an algorithm to find a radical dude
And her hair might usb comaptible too

We box with rooks, and we're talking box
I think we've got chemistry, but she's the cook
Just gotta convince her I'm a standup guy
'Cause I like big brains and I cannot lieI've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corners selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door
While gripping a.44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker put the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace, and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit, but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't in a fairy tale, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you've got a fucking problem bitch I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a peace
I just kill'em with kindness, yeah we leave 'em deceased
And tell it like it is and now you got it capish shorty waddup!

Let me bring it back down
You think it's a game right now (yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)
Back where I came from now
We're gon' live it up
Till we bring it back down

I hope you live a long life hatin'
And watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they'll probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out they so repetitive
Shout out my Homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make a shooting from the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a cold world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, whoa
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it Rattpack, till the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seek though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind stays celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz
My flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor
Murder all rappers in front of they momma's
I rip Artanis
Decipher the word because it's eubonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra
Yes, I got you bitch it's Logic

Let me bring it back down
You think it's a game right now (yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)
Back where I came from now
We're gon' live it up
Till we bring it back downOkay it's RattPack till my pulse flat
We keep it real, no false rap
I got four cards and they all black
Got four broads and they all that
We call that ballin'
Doing this is my calling
Flow is so appallin'
My phone off and she callin'
I'm like, "Yeah, what it do?"
Penthouse man what a view
Fall back 'cause I'm coming through
With my whole team they coming too
That's real, too real
Motherfucker tell me how you feel
I'm too good for my own good
I won't leak the album, I'll let it spill
Number one, bitch I bet it will
Do the numbers I said it will
I played the game and I'm still the same
And I never changed just to get a deal
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
I came from nuttin to something
Like it's nuttin, yeah you know I done it
Now there's no discussion
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into
Tens and commas
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
Closing million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning
Hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin'
Going places they never go
It ain't all about the money
But I stack it 'cause you never know
I'ma live life till I overdose
While they sleepin' on me, that's comatose
I went mainstream with my main team
You just mad as fuck you ain't come close
And yo next girl is my ex-girl
She fine as hell, but she a mess girl
All I do is rhyme, I got no time
So I can't reply to yo text girl
Bitch I'm back again and I run it
Always gotta keep it one hundred
All of y'all know y'all want it
Turn it up and get blunted
I'm like fuck the money, fuck the fame
I came here to fuck up the game
Gon' get it, I'm feeling myself
Fresh to death, bitch I'm killing myself
I'm gone, we burnin' it up
Step in the building we turnin' it up
Talking that shit, but they never admit
When I step to the mic I be murderin' it
And we living real good
Mainstream, but it's still good
I got raw shit, I got real shit
But right now it's time for that feel good
We call that ballin'
Doing this is my calling
Flow is so appallin'

Hold on, let me slow it down so y'all get the shit
These haters talk but I don't give a shit
Got models, bottles and the piff is lit
But we ballin', kinda like Spalding and Rawlings
On the road to riches never stallin
Got yo girl all up all on my nuts
But she do it with joy, no almonds, ugh
Living life to perfection
VIP that's the section
Presidential watch, presidential suites
You would think we held an election
It go Logic first then I'm up next
I do not converse I just cut checks
I do not rehearse, I just drop the verse
I need to cop a hearse 'cause I'm fresh to death
I bet you never seen so much designer
Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer
Boy, I stunt when I ain't even tryna
Swaggin is nice but first I'ma rhymer
And I rep Maryland, home of the Terrapins
Say you spit crack homie we spit that heroin
Bring it right to your front door like I'm caroling
Standing next to me would be so embarrassing yeah we be ballin'
Ballin', ballin'
I came from nuttin to something
Like it's nuttin, yeah you know I done it
Now there's no discussion
