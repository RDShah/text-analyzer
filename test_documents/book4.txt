Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee lived in the ocean. All day long she clung to the same slippery rock with her single big foot. Her tiny tentacles caught tasty tr On days when she felt cross, her stinging tentacles kept the other creatures away. But today her rock felt lonely. I am different to every other creature.” “I have no fins. I have no feet. “Even that hermit crab is off having adventures!” “Save me! That fish wants to pluck me out of my shell!” “Go away, you big bully!” The big fish bared his teeth, but was afraid of being stung. Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee whipped up her stinging tentacles and hid the hermit underneath them. He gave up and swam away with a cheeky flick of his tail. “That was close!” said the crab. “Is it safe now?” “You can come out, Crab. What’s your name?” “Herman. I’m a hermit, but I think I need a bodyguard. I wish I was as brave as you!” “I’m Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee. I wish I had amazing adventures like you.” “But why don’t you?” He asked. “Well, I don’t have stings, but I do have an idea!” “I’m stuck to my rock. And I don’t have legs!” She replied. Herman took Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee by the tentacle and danced around her, pulling silly faces. First Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee snorted, and then she giggled — and then she laughed so hard she popped right off her rock. Herman gently picked her up and settled her on his shell. “Are you ready? I feel an adventure coming on.” He said. Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee adventures all over the ocean, catching tasty treats. Now she only uses her stinging tentacles to keep the nasty fish away from Herman. And she never, ever feels lonely.
